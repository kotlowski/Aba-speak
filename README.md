Khan Academy Excersize I thought was fun.

  
Aba Speak is a game invented by school children to disquise what they are speaking.
  
When speaking, they transform each word following this algorithm.
  
For each letter in word  
   if letter is vowel  
      add 'b' after  
      add letter after 'b'  
  
This test case was 'Avocado'
Which will produce the result : 'abavobocabadobo'.
