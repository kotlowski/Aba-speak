Khan Academy Excersize I thought was fun.


Aba Speak is a game invented by school children to disquise what they are speaking.

When speaking they transform each word following this algorithm.

For each letter in word
   if letter is vowel
      add 'b' after
      add letter after 'b'

This test case was 'Avocado'
Which will produce the result : 'abavobocabadobo'.
